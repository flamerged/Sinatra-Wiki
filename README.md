# Sinatra-Wiki
Small and very primitive Wiki page built using the Sinatra webframework

Final project in the "Learn Ruby" track on TeamTreehouse.com. The Goal was to create a simple Wiki page to learn CRUD operations and routing using the Sinatra framework.

### Things learned in the course:

* Importing and using Sinatra
* Routing requests
* Simple CRUD operations using files instead of a database
* HTML templating using .erb files
* Serving static files through the public folder

To test the app run the following command in your terminal:

```
ruby wiki.rb
```
After running the command you can access the website from http://localhost:4567/

*Notice: You might want to add a pages folder in the root directory in case you get an error message when creating wiki pages*
